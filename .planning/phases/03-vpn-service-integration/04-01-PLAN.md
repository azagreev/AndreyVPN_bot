# Plan 04-01: Profile Request & Delivery

## Goal
Implement the user interface and admin workflow for requesting and delivering VPN profiles.

## Tasks
1. [ ] **Dependencies**: Add `segno` to `requirements.txt`.
2. [ ] **Database**: (Optional) Check if `vpn_profiles` needs additional fields (already has user_id, name, keys, ip).
3. [ ] **VPN Service Expansion**: 
    - Add QR code generation to `VPNService`.
4. [ ] **User UI**:
    - Create a main menu keyboard for approved users.
    - Implement a handler for the "Request VPN" button.
5. [ ] **Admin Workflow**:
    - Implement handler for VPN request approval.
    - Upon approval: trigger profile creation and send assets (QR + file) to the user.
6. [ ] **Verification**:
    - Test the full flow from request to delivery.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can see a "Request VPN" button after approval.
- [ ] Admin receives a notification when a user requests a VPN.
- [ ] User receives a valid `.conf` file and a QR code after admin approval.
